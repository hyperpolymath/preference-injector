## 🎯 Bronze Level Requirements (Minimum 70%)

### ✅ Currently Passing (4/11)
1. ✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, full type definitions
2. ✅ **Licensing**: MIT license present
3. ⚠️ **Documentation**: Partial (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING exist)
4. ⚠️ **Testing**: Partial (some unit tests, need 100% pass rate)

### ❌ Currently Failing (7/11)
1. ❌ **Memory Safety**: Need Rust/Ada core or explicit WASM sandboxing
2. ❌ **Offline-First**: GraphQL API requires network, no local-first architecture
3. ❌ **Build System**: Missing Justfile and flake.nix
4. ❌ **Security**: Missing SECURITY.md and .well-known/ directory
5. ❌ **Post-Quantum Crypto**: Designed but not implemented
6. ❌ **TPCF**: No tri-perimeter framework or governance model
7. ❌ **Distribution**: No editor snippets or platform templates

## 🚀 Action Plan: Achieve Bronze (70%+)

### Phase 1: Critical Blockers (Must-Have)
- [ ] Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with emotional safety metrics
- [ ] Add MAINTAINERS.md with TPCF perimeter assignment
- [ ] Create .well-known/security.txt (RFC 9116)
- [ ] Create .well-known/ai.txt (AI training policies)
- [ ] Create .well-known/humans.txt (attribution)
- [ ] Add Justfile with 20+ recipes
- [ ] Add flake.nix for reproducible Nix builds
- [ ] Implement offline-first architecture with IndexedDB/OPFS
- [ ] Add dual MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 licensing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Compliance (Nice-to-Have)
- [ ] Implement post-quantum crypto (Ed448, Kyber1024, BLAKE3)
- [ ] Add CRDT-based state synchronization
- [ ] Create RSR self-verification tool
- [ ] Implement TPCF access control system
- [ ] Add ReScript type-safe core modules
- [ ] Create multi-language FFI contracts

### Phase 3: Silver/Gold Path (Future)
- [ ] Full formal verification with SPARK Ada proofs
- [ ] WASM sandboxing for untrusted code
- [ ] Distributed testing across 3+ platforms
- [ ] Reproducible builds on 5+ architectures
- [ ] Supply chain attestation (SLSA Level 3+)

## 📋 Missing Files Inventory

### Documentation (High Priority)
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` - CVE reporting, security policies
- [ ] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines, emotional safety
- [ ] `MAINTAINERS.md` - TPCF perimeter, access controls
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design, post-quantum architecture
- [ ] `GOVERNANCE.md` - Decision-making process

### .well-known/ Directory (High Priority)
- [ ] `.well-known/security.txt` - RFC 9116 security contact
- [ ] `.well-known/ai.txt` - AI training policies
- [ ] `.well-known/humans.txt` - Human contributors
- [ ] `.well-known/funding.txt` - Sponsorship information

### Build System (High Priority)
- [ ] `justfile` - Command runner with recipes
- [ ] `flake.nix` - Nix reproducible builds
- [ ] `Makefile` - Traditional build system fallback
- [ ] `.envrc` - direnv integration

### Testing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate
- [ ] RSR compliance verification script
- [ ] Property-based testing with QuickCheck
- [ ] Mutation testing

### Distribution (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Platform-specific templates (GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket)
- [ ] Editor snippets (VS Code, Vim, Emacs)
- [ ] Git workflow templates
- [ ] Docker/Podman images

### Legal (Low Priority)
- [ ] `PATENTS.md` - Patent grant (if applicable)
- [ ] `TRADEMARK.md` - Trademark policy
- [ ] `PALIMPSEST-LICENSE.txt` - Full Palimpsest v0.8 text

## 🎓 Lessons from rhodium-minimal

The reference implementation shows:
1. **Zero dependencies** is achievable (we have 15+ npm packages)
2. **Offline-first** means no network calls in core logic
3. **100 lines** proves concept (we're at 6,000+ lines)
4. **justfile** is primary interface (20+ recipes minimum)
5. **TPCF Perimeter 3** is default for new projects

---

## 🔧 Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Run compliance check**: `deno run scripts/rsr-verify.ts`
2. **Add missing docs**: Start with SECURITY.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
3. **Create .well-known/**: security.txt is RFC standard
4. **Add Justfile**: Port npm scripts to just recipes
5. **Implement offline mode**: IndexedDB for local-first storage

## 📈 Projected Timeline to Bronze

- **Week 1**: Documentation and .well-known/ (⬆️ to 55%)
- **Week 2**: Build system and offline-first (⬆️ to 65%)
- **Week 3**: TPCF and testing (⬆️ to 75% - **Bronze Certified**)
- **Month 2**: Post-quantum crypto (⬆️ to 85% - **Silver Track**)
- **Month 3**: Formal verification (⬆️ to 95% - **Gold Track**)
